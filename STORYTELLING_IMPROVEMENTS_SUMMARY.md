# üé¨ STORYTELLING IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### ‚ùå **Issue 1: TTS Distortion (Single Words)**

**Problem**: Each panel had only one word, slideshow ended in ~15 seconds instead of ~60 seconds (10 seconds per panel)
**Root Cause**: dialogue_text was too short, not meeting 25-40 word requirement for proper 10-second narration
**Solution**:

- Updated `STORY_ARCHITECT_PROMPT` with explicit 25-40 word requirements for each panel
- Added clear TTS guidelines emphasizing "NOT single words!"
- Enhanced dialogue_text templates with specific word count instructions
- Each panel now generates substantial narration for proper ~10 second voice-over

### ‚ùå **Issue 2: Missing Story Progression**

**Problem**: No environmental changes, props, or story elements - just static character poses
**Root Cause**: Over-emphasis on character consistency eliminated story progression elements
**Solution**:

- Updated consistency requirements to ALLOW story progression while maintaining character consistency:
  - ‚úÖ ALLOW ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESSION - settings, lighting, atmospheric changes
  - ‚úÖ ALLOW PROP INTERACTIONS - character interactions with meaningful objects
  - ‚úÖ ALLOW EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION CHANGES - different expressions showing growth
  - ‚úÖ ALLOW ATMOSPHERIC VARIATIONS - lighting, weather, mood changes
- Enhanced image prompt generation with story progression elements
- Added panel-specific environmental evolution and atmospheric context

### ‚ùå **Issue 3: Wrong Voice Locale (en-US instead of en-IN)**

**Problem**: TTS using American accent instead of Indian accent
**Solution**:

- Updated all voice configurations in `chirp3hd_tts_service.py`
- Changed all voice names from `en-US-Chirp3-HD-*` to `en-IN-Chirp3-HD-*`
- Updated language_code from "en-US" to "en-IN"
- Updated fallback voice configuration to en-IN

## ‚úÖ **Maintained: Character Consistency**

**Success**: Sneha consistently appears as female character while allowing story progression
**Approach**:

- Kept strict character identity enforcement (name, gender, age, appearance)
- Maintained visual consistency across panels
- Allowed story elements to evolve while character stays consistent

```

### 2. `services/chirp3hd_tts_service.py` - Voice Configuration

**Changes Made**:

- Updated all voice selection logic from en-US to en-IN

```
