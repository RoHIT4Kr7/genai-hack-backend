# 🎯 CRITICAL DISCOVERY - The Real Issue!

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE FOUND:**

You've been accessing the **WRONG URL** this entire time!

### ✅ **Correct URLs:**

- **Landing Page**: `http://localhost:8080/` (Index.tsx - just a hero section)
- **Mental Wellness App**: `http://localhost:8080/mental-wellness` ← **THIS IS WHERE THE APP IS!**

### ❌ **What You Were Probably Doing:**

- Accessing `http://localhost:8080/` (wrong - just shows landing page)
- Or accessing a completely different URL

## 🧪 **IMMEDIATE TEST:**

1. **Open**: `http://localhost:8080/mental-wellness`
2. **You should see**: Onboarding screen with the mental wellness form
3. **Fill out the form** and submit
4. **Watch console** for Socket.IO events

## 📁 **Frontend Structure:**

```
src/
├── App.tsx (contains routing + MentalWellnessApp component)
├── pages/
│   └── Index.tsx (landing page at "/")
└── components/
    ├── OnboardingScreen.tsx
    ├── LoadingScreen.tsx
    └── MangaViewer.tsx
```

## 🛣️ **Routing Setup:**

```typescript
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
  <Route path="/mental-wellness" element={<MentalWellnessApp />} />
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
</Routes>
```

## 🔧 **Additional Issues to Check:**

### 1. **Static Assets Path**

```typescript
backgroundMusicUrl: "/src/assets/audio/background-music.mp3";
```

This might need to be `/assets/audio/background-music.mp3` in production.

### 2. **Socket.IO Port Configuration**

Since frontend is on port 8080, make sure there are no CORS issues:

```typescript
socketRef.current = io("http://localhost:8000", {
  transports: ["websocket", "polling"],
});
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Access the correct URL**: `http://localhost:8080/mental-wellness`
2. **Test the onboarding flow**
3. **Check console for Socket.IO connection logs**
4. **Verify panel 1 completion triggers slideshow**

**This explains why you saw no logs - you weren't even running the mental wellness app!** 🤦‍♂️
