# Image Generation and TTS Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified from Terminal Logs

### 1. Image Generation Quota Exceeded Errors

- **Problem**: Panels 4 and 6 failed with `429 Quota exceeded` errors
- **Root Cause**: Google Vertex AI Imagen quota limits were hit
- **Impact**: Story generation stopped at slideshow 3, panels 4 and 6 were missing

### 2. TTS Content Too Short

- **Problem**: TTS content was only 20-40 words, resulting in 5-8 seconds of audio
- **Root Cause**: TTS guidelines specified too short content length
- **Impact**: Poor user experience with very brief narration

### 3. No Retry/Fallback Mechanism

- **Problem**: When image generation failed, no fallback was provided
- **Root Cause**: Limited retry attempts (3) and no fallback strategy
- **Impact**: Complete failure of story generation when quota exceeded

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Retry Mechanism (`utils/retry_helpers.py`)

- **Increased retry attempts**: From 3 to 8 for image generation
- **Extended delays**: Maximum delay increased from 40s to 120s
- **Quota-specific handling**: Double delays for quota exceeded errors
- **Better logging**: Clear indication when quota exceeded delays are applied

### 2. Improved TTS Content Generation (`utils/helpers.py`)

- **Extended content length**: From 20-40 words to 60-100 words
- **Target duration**: 10-15 seconds of narration per panel
- **Enhanced guidelines**: Added emotional depth, character introspection, and descriptive language
- **Better flow**: Each panel's narration is now self-contained and meaningful

### 3. Fallback Image Generation (`services/image_service.py`)

- **Fallback prompts**: Simplified prompts when quota exceeded
- **Placeholder images**: Generated when all else fails
- **Graceful degradation**: Story continues even with placeholder images

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling (`services/panel_processor.py`)

- **Quota detection**: Automatically detects quota exceeded errors
- **Fallback triggering**: Automatically tries fallback generation
- **Progress updates**: Emits fallback status to frontend

## Technical Details

### Retry Strategy

```python
# Before: 3 retries, max 40s delay
max_retries=3, max_delay=40.0

# After: 8 retries, max 120s delay, double delays for quota errors
max_retries=8, max_delay=120.0
# Plus special handling for quota exceeded errors
```

### TTS Content Guidelines

```python
# Before: 20-40 words (5-8 seconds)
"Each panel should be 20-40 words for optimal audio length"

# After: 60-100 words (10-15 seconds)
"Each panel should be 60-100 words for optimal audio length (10-15 seconds of narration)"
```

### Fallback Strategy

1. **Primary**: Try original prompt with extended retries
2. **Secondary**: Try simplified fallback prompt
3. **Tertiary**: Generate placeholder image with text overlay

## Expected Results

### Image Generation

- **Higher success rate**: More retries with longer delays
- **Graceful degradation**: Fallback images when quota exceeded
- **Better user experience**: Story continues even with limitations

### TTS Content

- **Longer narration**: 10-15 seconds per panel instead of 5-8 seconds
- **Richer content**: More emotional depth and character development
- **Better flow**: Each panel feels complete and meaningful

### Overall System

- **Resilience**: System continues working even with API limitations
- **User feedback**: Clear progress updates and fallback notifications
- **Consistency**: All 6 panels will be generated (with fallbacks if needed)

## Monitoring

Monitor these log patterns:

- `[QUOTA EXCEEDED - EXTENDED DELAY]` - Shows quota handling is working
- `Fallback image generated for panel X` - Shows fallback mechanism working
- `Created placeholder image for panel X` - Shows final fallback working

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor quota usage**: Track when quota limits are hit
2. **Consider quota increase**: Request higher limits from Google if needed
3. **Optimize prompts**: Further simplify prompts to reduce quota usage
4. **Cache successful images**: Store and reuse successful panel images
