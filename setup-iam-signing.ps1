.SYNOPSIS
    Setup IAM Service Account Credentials API for signed URL generation in Cloud Run

.DESCRIPTION
    This script enables the IAM Service Account Credentials API and grants the necessary
    permissions for Cloud Run service accounts to generate signed URLs using the 
    SignBlob operation.

.NOTES
    This is the recommended keyless approach for Cloud Run signed URL generation.
    It eliminates the need for service account private keys by using IAM Credentials API.
