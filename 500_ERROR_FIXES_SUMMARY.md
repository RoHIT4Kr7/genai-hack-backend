# 500 Error Prevention & Panel Generation Improvements

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

The application was experiencing frequent **500 INTERNAL** errors from Google's image generation API, causing panels to fallback even with available quota. This occurred because:

1. **Rapid Sequential Requests**: All 6 panels generated simultaneously overwhelmed Google's servers
2. **Insufficient Retry Logic**: Basic retry didn't handle 500 server overload errors properly
3. **No Request Spacing**: Lack of timing control between API calls
4. **Limited Backoff Strategy**: Exponential backoff wasn't optimized for server overload scenarios

## ✅ Implemented Solutions

### 1. **Staggered Panel Generation**

```python
# Before: All panels generated simultaneously
panel_tasks = [generate_panel(panel) for panel in panels]
results = await asyncio.gather(*panel_tasks)

# After: Staggered with 0.5-second intervals
for i, panel in enumerate(panels):
    delay = i * 0.5  # 0s, 0.5s, 1.0s, 1.5s, 2.0s, 2.5s
    task = delayed_panel_task(panel, delay)
```

### 2. **Enhanced Retry Logic for 500 Errors**

- **Increased max retries**: 3 → 4 attempts specifically for server errors
- **Improved backoff timing**: `2^(attempt+1)` with 16-second cap for 500 errors
- **Specific 500 error handling**: Continue retrying for server overload, but stop for quota errors
- **Better error classification**: Distinguish between retryable (500) and non-retryable (quota) errors

### 3. **Rate Limiting System**

```python
class NanoBananaService:
    def __init__(self):
        self._last_request_time = 0
        self._min_request_interval = 0.5  # 500ms minimum between requests

    async def _apply_rate_limiting(self):
        """Ensure minimum spacing between API calls"""
```

### 4. **Pre-Request Delays**

- **Reference generation spacing**: 2-second pause after reference images
- **Initial request delay**: 0.2-second delay before first attempt
- **Retry delays**: Enhanced exponential backoff for server errors

### 5. **Comprehensive Error Handling**

```python
if "500" in error_msg or "internal" in error_msg.lower():
    logger.warning("🔄 Server overload detected, will retry with backoff")
    # Continue retrying with longer delays
elif "quota" in error_msg.lower():
    logger.error("Non-retryable quota error")
    break  # Don't retry quota errors
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before (Problematic):

- ❌ Rapid simultaneous requests → 500 server overload
- ❌ Short retry delays → Failed to wait for server recovery
- ❌ 2-3 panels consistently failing → Fallback images
- ❌ Poor user experience with inconsistent generation

### After (Improved):

- ✅ **Staggered requests** → Reduced server load
- ✅ **Enhanced retry logic** → Better handling of temporary server issues
- ✅ **Rate limiting** → Prevents API overwhelming
- ✅ **Longer backoff delays** → Allows server recovery time
- ✅ **Higher success rate** → Fewer fallback panels needed

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Staggered Timing Strategy:

```
Panel 1: Starts immediately (0s delay)
Panel 2: Starts after 0.5s delay
Panel 3: Starts after 1.0s delay
Panel 4: Starts after 1.5s delay
Panel 5: Starts after 2.0s delay
Panel 6: Starts after 2.5s delay
```

### Retry Backoff Schedule:

```
Attempt 1: Immediate (with rate limiting)
Attempt 2: Wait 4 seconds + rate limiting
Attempt 3: Wait 8 seconds + rate limiting
Attempt 4: Wait 16 seconds + rate limiting
```

### Error-Specific Handling:

- **500 INTERNAL**: Retry with exponential backoff (up to 4 attempts)
- **Quota exceeded**: Immediate failure, don't retry
- **Other errors**: Retry with standard backoff

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Reduced 500 Errors**: Staggered requests prevent server overload
2. **Higher Success Rate**: Better retry logic handles temporary issues
3. **Improved Consistency**: More panels generated successfully = better story coherence
4. **Better User Experience**: Fewer fallback panels, more complete stories
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Smarter retries reduce wasted API calls

## 🚀 Usage

The improvements are automatically applied to all manga generation requests. Users will experience:

- More consistent panel generation
- Fewer "fallback panel" messages
- Improved story visual consistency
- Better handling of temporary API issues

## 📈 Monitoring

Enhanced logging provides visibility into:

```
⏱️  Panel 2: Waiting 1.0s to prevent API overload...
🔄 Server overload detected for panel 3, will retry with backoff
⏱️  Waiting 8s before retry (handling server overload)...
✅ Panel 3 generated successfully after retry
```

This comprehensive approach addresses the root causes of 500 errors while maintaining the motivational anime experience that helps users overcome their specific struggles.
